# Project Rules

- **Python Virtual Environment**: Always use the virtual environment located at `backend/.venv/bin/python` or `backend/.venv/bin/pytest` for all backend commands.
- **TDD/Tidy First**: Follow the instructions in `plan.md` and `plans/milestone-6.md` precisely. Always follow the TDD cycle: Red -> Green -> Refactor.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Never mix structural (Tidy First) and behavioral changes in the same commit or step.
